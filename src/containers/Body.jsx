					<Project

						title="Inventory Tracker"
						stack={['React', 'Node.js', 'MySQL']}
					>
						Worked at Sawgrass Nutra Labs, a contract manufacurer
						for suplements, as a Machine Operator. After seeing
						that they were tracking their inventory with Excel I
						decided to build them a better system. I designed and 
						built dashboard views for Sawgrassâ€™s nutraceutical 
						inventory tracking software. Deployed React frontend
						code with AWS S3. Utilized Python AWS Lambda functions 
						and MySQL to build out backend inventory tracking 
						functionality. Added logging to the backend using AWS
						CloudWatch and created reports on user behavior to 
						drive product direction. Allowd Sawgrass to be 5% 
						more eficient in there ordering completion process.
						reduced inventory tracking error by over 13%
